### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a trans woman who makes a living making Android apps. With a whopping 3 years of experience in the dreadful banking market, I try to make pet projects to play around the newest tools and shiny libraries. Oh, and I'm also kicking around with iOS development for shits and giggles.

About me personally... I'm a massive fan of MMOs, specially FFXIV, and pretty much any music genre. I went vegan (or rather, plant-based) at the beginning of 2020!

You will always catch me working on a Mac, but I wouldn't refuse a Linux machine tbh. Just don't you ever make me work on Windows, that's rude.

Anyway, this is getting too long... wear your mask, be nice to people and take care of trans folk!
